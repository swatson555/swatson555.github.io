My personal blog. Uses [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) for static site generation.

# Design Goals
Accessibility and function were the primary criteria for the design of this site. The following were considerations and goals:

* primitive shapes
* useful visual tension
* high contrasting colors
* clear metaphors
* consistency of information

These were used to create the hierarchy of information. Primary content is always center framed. Simple and primary information always lay "above" secondary information. Metaphors are simple like a list or a piece of paper. Images were included in the landing page to add personality at the outset but, aren't included in the articles so that the content would be in focus.
