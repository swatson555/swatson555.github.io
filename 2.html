<p>Lisp is often known as one of the oldest programming languages. Indeed, it's conception can be traced back to research done by John McCarthy in 1960. In these series of articles I present an implementation of a Lisp written in the C language. These articles assume some familiarity in a Lisp like Scheme or Common Lisp.</p>

<p>Monads are often a point of frustration for learners of Haskell. The question of what a monad is leads to the question of why a monad is. The question of why a monad is leads to the question of what a monad is. It's been said that the IO monad is special. This is wrong. It's time that these myths be debunked. This article seeks to answer the question of what a monad is.</p>
